## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern supply chains face unprecedented complexity and challenges:

- **Lack of Visibility** - Limited real-time insights across the supply chain network, leading to blind spots in operations
- **Data Silos** - Fragmented data across multiple systems (warehouses, logistics, suppliers) prevents holistic analysis
- **Reactive Decision Making** - Absence of predictive analytics forces businesses to respond to problems rather than prevent them
- **Performance Bottlenecks** - Inability to identify and address inefficiencies in procurement, transportation, and distribution
- **Risk Management** - Poor visibility into supplier reliability, delivery delays, and disruption patterns
- **Cost Inefficiencies** - Suboptimal routing, excess inventory, and poor demand forecasting increase operational costs
- **Manual Reporting** - Time-consuming report generation delays critical business decisions
- **Customer Satisfaction** - Unpredictable delivery times and stockouts damage customer relationships

These challenges result in revenue loss, competitive disadvantage, and operational inefficiency across the supply chain ecosystem.
